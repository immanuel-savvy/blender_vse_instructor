Blender VSE Instructor - Add-on scaffold

Structure included in this document. Copy each file into the matching path and install the add-on in Blender (Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install...).

This scaffold includes basic operator stubs and a working register/unregister so Blender can load the add-on. Implement core logic in core/ and ops/ modules.
